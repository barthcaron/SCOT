# Single-Cell alignment using Optimal Transport (SCOT)
*Note: We are currently updating this repository with v.2.0 changes to the algorithm.

SCOT is a python tool for performing unsupervised alignment of single-cell multi-omics datasets. Its methodology is detailed in the following two papers:
- SCOT v.1.0: [Gromov-Wasserstein based optimal transport for aligning single-cell multi-omics data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.066787v2)
- SCOT v.2.0: [Unsupervised integration of single-cell multi-omics datasets with disparities in cell-type representation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.09.467903v1)
